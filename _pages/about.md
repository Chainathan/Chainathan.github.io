I am a **Machine Learning Engineer** at the [Quantitative Neuroscience Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/maijia-liao-homepage/) and a Computer Science graduate student at Northeastern University. My focus is on designing **advanced AI solutions** in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP, with a vision for creating versatile, multi-modal systems that adapt across text, image, and audio inputs.

My technical expertise includes **multimodal models**, Diffusion models, and LLMs, with frameworks like PyTorch, OpenCV, and Hugging Face. I have hands-on experience fine-tuning state-of-the-art models like Llama, Stable Diffusion, and YOLO, and extensive skills in tools such as MATLAB and ImageJ. From model development to deployment, I build custom frameworks to optimize adaptability and performance.

Guided by [Prof. Raymond](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h-JEcQ8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Maijia Liao](https://sites.google.com/view/maijia-liao-homepage/team?authuser=0), I develop neural networks to track protein dynamics in **microscopy videos** of dendrites, achieving precise neuron segmentation. Additionally, under [Prof. Venkat Rajagopal](https://rajagopalvenkat.com/)'s mentorship, I am working on a privacy-preserving mobile app that detects and obscures sensitive content on-device using Vision Transformers, empowering users with greater control over their data. These projects reflect my commitment to impactful, cross-disciplinary AI applications.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
